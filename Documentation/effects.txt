| Summary of Effects.
Unify Volume and General Effects.
Unify Up and Down Effects by using signed values. (at transformation stage or already in the song stored effect)

|
|  Volume Column effects.
|   Ax Fine volume slide up by x	-> in SamplePlayback
|   Bx Fine volume slide down by x	-> in SamplePlayback
|   Cx Volume slide up by x		-> in SamplePlayback
|   Dx Volume slide down by x		-> in SamplePlayback
|   Ex Pitch slide down by x		-> in SamplePlayback
|   Fx Pitch slide up by x		-> in SamplePlayback
|   Gx Slide to note with speed x	-> in SamplePlayback
|   Hx Vibrato with depth x		-> in SamplePlayback
|
|  General effects.
|   Axx Set song speed (hex)				-> apply once
|   Bxx Jump to Order (hex)				-> apply once (same as above)
|   Cxx Break to row xx (hex) of next pattern		-> apply once
|   D0x Volume slide down by x				-> in SamplePlayback
|   Dx0 Volume slide up by x				-> in SamplePlayback
|   DFx Fine volume slide down by x			-> in SamplePlayback
|   DxF Fine volume slide up by x			-> in SamplePlayback
|   Exx Pitch slide down by xx				-> in SamplePlayback
|   EFx Fine pitch slide down by x			-> in SamplePlayback
|   EEx Extra fine pitch slide down by x		-> in SamplePlayback
|   Fxx Pitch slide up by xx				-> in SamplePlayback
|   FFx Fine pitch slide up by x			-> in SamplePlayback
|   FEx Extra fine pitch slide up by x			-> in SamplePlayback
|   Gxx Slide to note with speed xx			-> in SamplePlayback
|   Hxy Vibrato with speed x, depth y			-> in SamplePlayback
|   Ixy Tremor with ontime x and offtime y		-> in SamplePlayback
|   Jxy Arpeggio with halftones x and y			-> Wrapper around SamplePlayback, which triggers the notes
|   Kxx Dual Command: H00 & Dxx				-> in SamplePlayback
|   Lxx Dual Command: G00 & Dxx				-> in SamplePlayback
|   Mxx Set channel volume to xx (0->40h)		-> apply once
|   N0x Channel volume slide down by x			-> in PlaybackState
|   Nx0 Channel volume slide up by x			-> in PlaybackState

|   Px0 Panning slide to left by x			-> in SamplePlayback
|   PFx Fine panning slide to right by x		-> in SamplePlayback
|   PxF Fine panning slide to left by x			-> in SamplePlayback
|   Qxy Retrigger note every y ticks with volume modifier x
|     Values for x:
|       0: No volume change         8: Not used		-> Wrapper around SamplePlayback. Needs to be aware of ticks somehow
|       1: -1                       9: +1			(registered tick callback? Probably self-referential) or it
|       2: -2                       A: +2			would live in PlaybackState (but how)
|       3: -4                       B: +4
|       4: -8                       C: +8
|       5: -16                      D: +16
|       6: *2/3                     E: *3/2
|       7: *1/2                     F: *2
